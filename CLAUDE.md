- Test organization switching thoroughly when making UI changes

### Data Management
- Applications can have organization-specific statuses
- `data-manager.ts` handles automatic synchronization
- State changes trigger UI updates through subscription pattern
- Local storage keys are prefixed with organization type

### Islamic Compliance
- Never modify Islamic jurisprudence database without expert consultation
- All ingredient classifications include Quranic/Hadith references with Arabic text and transliteration
- Confidence scores must reflect scholarly consensus accuracy from authenticated Islamic sources
- Religious sensitivity is paramount in all user-facing content
- Database includes 500+ ingredients covering E-numbers, enzymes, vitamins, biotechnology, and contemporary food additives
- Classifications sourced from Quran, authentic Hadith, four major Sunni schools, and contemporary fatawa from JAKIM, MUI, ISNA, and European Council for Fatwa
- **Critical Categories Covered**: E-numbers (E631, E627, E120, etc.), industrial enzymes, vitamins (D3, B12), emulsifiers, natural flavors, food colorings, preservatives, and modern biotechnology ingredients
- **Authentication Standards**: Conservative MASHBOOH classification when doubt exists, source verification requirements, madhab differences noted

### Performance Considerations
- **Analysis sessions persist for 24 hours** to improve UX
- **Real GPT-4 API calls**: 30-60 second response times due to authentic AI processing
- **OpenAI API integration**: Direct calls to GPT-4 model without mock data
- **Conservative timeout handling**: Extended timeouts for complex ingredient analysis
