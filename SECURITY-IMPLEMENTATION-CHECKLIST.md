```

### **Advanced Security Tools (Week 2-3)**
```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs          # Error monitoring
npm install node-clamav             # Virus scanning
npm install device-fingerprint      # Device tracking
npm install express-slow-down        # Progressive delays
npm install express-brute           # Brute force protection
```

### **Security Services to Setup**
